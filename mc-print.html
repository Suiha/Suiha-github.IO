<h2>Exploding Boba</h2>

<p>I wanted to play around with Minecraft's 3D design by creating a boba drink, but with the boba popping out and exploding out of the drink.</p>
<p>Boba is very popular today, but I used to drink boba ever since I was little, when the classic at the smallest size costed only $3 per cup. Probably even less.</p>

<h2>Exploding Boba: 3D</h2>

<p>My initial design from Minecraft wasn't as well suited to 3D printing as I thought. The boba on top, which was originally supposed to be flying outward in a trail of liquid, had to be downgraded.</p>
<p>Other than that my biggest challenge was figuring out what to do with the supports. Because of the boba on the sides and the lid of the cup, there would be supports covering the entire build. Due to the sheer amount of them, I also had to worry about supports being built into the print itself.</p>
<p>There are a few areas where the print looks "caved in" because the support was built into it. But thankfully it's not very noticeable and I'm overall satisfied with how it came out.</p>
