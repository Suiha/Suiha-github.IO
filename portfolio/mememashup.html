	<h2 style="text-align:center;">What's a Meme?</h2>
	<p style="text-align:center;">
A meme is "a cultural idea or behavior that spreads between people without genes being involved" (SciShow 2017). They come in many different forms - photo edits, cartoon panels, short videos, audio clips, etc. and are a way people express creativity, spread ideas, and create jokes. Sometimes memes are spliced or mashed together to represent a new idea.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;">I used Photoshop to mash together 3 different memes to create a piece about Dio Brando from <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood</i>.</p>

	<p><b>Spoilers for <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood</i>.</b></p>
	<p>At the end of the season, Dio Brando is left as a headless vampire who decides to steal Jonathan's body as a replacement for his own. After cornering Jonathan aboard a cruise ship by setting it on fire, Dio has one last battle against Jonathan.</p>
	<p>The <i>This is Fine</i> meme is used to highlight Dio's insane plan to restore himself to glory, as well as reflect the literal fire the finale takes place in.</p>
	<p><i>Wolverine Crush</i> is used to emphasize how obsessed Dio is with Jonathan, to the point where he determines that the only thing worthy of replacing his body is Jonathan's body.</p>
