				My Curse of Strahd campaign has 5 player characters, so I made 5 digital illustrations to represent those
				characters. I wanted to make each piece distinct from each other, so each piece has a different composition. 
				Some make illustrations make references to their past and some are simply depictions of the character themselves. Each 
				illustration is meant to represent something about the character that made an impression on me and how I visualize it.

				Dione is a young woman with a complicated past; abandoned by her original parents due to her 
				<a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:changeling" style="color:inherit;" target="_blank">changeling</a> nature, 
				she eventually found herself as a subject of human experimentation because of it. Now she searches for her missing guardian, 
				who had been captured while helping her escape.
			</p>
			<p>
				To represent her turbulent past, I drew Dione in her true form on an operating table, looking forlorn and with 
				some blood. I used the 3D modeling function in CSP to figure out posing and general shading. For her overall 
				design, I referenced portraits given to me by the player who created Dione.
			</p>
			<p>
				Drawing people has always been a challenge for me; although the 3D model alleviated some of the difficulty, I am dissatisfied 
				with the shape of the face and the lack of definition in her clothing. On the other hand, I think my color choice reflected 
				Dione's depressing past well.

	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Matrick "Matty" Lemine</h2>
	<br>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm col-md col-lg col-xl col-xxl">
			<p>
				Matrick "Matty" Lemine is a middle-aged mother of two 
				<a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:tiefling" style="color:inherit;" target="_blank">tiefling</a> twin daughters 
				named Rosie and Tully. Having raised them mostly on her own, Matty had to balance her parental duties with her regular 
				job as a mercenary. As adults, the twins have strayed from Matty's side to pursue their own lives as mercenaries 
				themselves. A few weeks have gone by since they were supposed to send her a letter, and now she travels to search for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a hobby, Matty has taken to knitting squares depicting the people she loves and notable events in her life, then 
				combining those into blankets. Rosie notably has bat wings while Tully has goat feet, so I illustrated a colorful 
				knitted blanket, with a bat and goat to represent them respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most challenging part of this illustration was layering a knitted texture onto the canvas and integrating it into 
				the piece as naturally as possible. The texture made it too difficult and tedious to give the blanket depth through shading, 
				as it had already taken several hours to integrate it.

	<!--Balmore section-->
	<h2 style="text-align:center">Balmore Caliban</h2>
	<br>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm col-md col-lg col-xl col-xxl" align="center">
			<img class="img-fluid" src="balmore_home.png" width="75%" height="75%" alt="Dione Illustration">
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm col-md col-lg col-xl col-xxl">
			<p>
				Balmore Caliban was trapped in Barovia alongside his parents when he was very young; as such, Barovia is all he knows, 
				despite having come from outside it. His parents settled in Vallaki, the largest settlement in Barovia, where he would 
				eventually meet his wife Claire.
			</p>
			<p>
				Claire was an optimisitc woman who dreamed of one day being able to see the sun. Balmore, who didn't know what the sun looked 
				like either, would make up stories to amuse her - some days he told her that the sun was green, other days he would tell her 
				it was actually blue. She often incoporated these made-up depictions into her sewing. However, she 
				passed away from illness many years ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				This illustration features a corner of the Caliban home where Claire would have spent her days sewing off-color suns into scarves 
				and tapestries. In the background, the bleak, sunless Vallaki awaits.
			</p>
			<p>
				The greatest challenges in making this piece was doing perspective, figuring out color choice, and designing the look of the room 
				and the street. I did not do perspective properly, so I find myself disatisfied with the proportions of the piece. I also struggled 
				to balance a relatively brighter inside (to represent Claire Caliban) with the more gray and muted outdoors. I also struggled to make 
				the composition feel complete while also implicitly missing something from the room (the presence of Claire). I might redo this piece 
				in the future.

			<p>
				Sunny Lanthan is a wizard with some 
				<a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:genasi-earth" style="color:inherit;" target="_blank">earth genasi</a> lineage. 
				Working for a noble, she was granted a dragonmark, a magical brand that would grant her new powers. However, the dragonmark 
				had adverse effects on her, which led to her losing her magical powers rather than gaining new ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunny's official portrait does not reveal her dragonmark; since it's on her forehead, she hides it behind a bandanna. 
				Although simple, I wanted to bring to life how the dragonmark would look on Sunny's face.

			<p>
				Donna lost her family to werewolves when she was young and was taken in by a monster-hunting organization. 
				She eventually turned out to be a monster-hunting prodigy, and her determination proved to be so overwhelming that 
				she came back to life after falling in battle.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Donna has started to become disillusioned with this way of life. Her organization only seems to view her as 
				a weapon rather than a person, and is looking to find some way away from a life filled with endless violence. This 
				illustration is meant to highlight that despair - being stuck as a tool for violence and her resentment towards it.
