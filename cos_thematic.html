				Curse of Strahd takes place in Barovia, and players are unable to venture away from it. As such, prominent certain landscapes 
				and characters will be reoccuring features in the adventure. Since I dedicated 5 of my 8 digital paintings to my 5 player 
				characters, that left only 3 images for Curse of Strahd itself. As such, I chose to highlight what I believed to be the most 
				iconic part of the adventure.

				Curse of Strahd's titular villain, Strahd von Zarovich, is not a one-time final boss. Through the adventure, 
				he is a constant presence in the main characters' journey; not only will he find ways to interact with them in-person, 
				but he also has spies throughout Barovia. He can also spy on the party himself through magical means.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the title page simply depicts two pairs of red eyes - Strahd's eyes - lurking in the darkness, staring out at you.

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm col-md col-lg col-xl col-xxl">
			<p>
				Castle Ravenloft is a location rife with history and a key location for the adventure - not only is it the main place where 
				the players can find Strahd, but it is also where the event that led to Barovia's current state occurred. Up on a cliff, not 
				far from the first settlement the players enter, Castle Ravenloft is a clear landmark in Barovia.
			</p>
			<p>
				I chose to depict Castle Ravenloft at night, the only time when the sky can be clear. The full moon casts an oppressive light 
				over the land and the castle looms over everything below it.

			<p>
				Ireena Kolyana is another important non-player character in the adventure - in the first area, the players are asked by her brother 
				to escort Ireena to a safe location, as Strahd has recently shown interest in making her one of his consorts, which is a fate 
				not many would wish for. In reality, Strahd wants to marry Ireena, as she is the latest reincarnation of his old love, Tatyana.
			</p>
			<p>
				In her first life, Tatyana rejected Strahd for his younger brother. Strahd, after being corrupted by Dark Powers, murdered his  
				brother to become an immortal vampire. Horrified, Tatyana threw herself off a cliff to escape him. However, now that Strahd's 
				new powers trapped Barovia from the outside world, her soul was also trapped within it, and so she would reincarnate several 
				times until her most recent one as Ireena.
			</p>
			<p>
				In contrast with the other illustration of Castle Ravenloft, the point of view for this piece is from the cliff where Castle 
				Ravenloft sits during the day, at the scene where Tatyana died.
